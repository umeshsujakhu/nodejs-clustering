üß© 1. Master-Worker Architecture in Node.js Clustering

Here‚Äôs how you can explain and visualize it:

‚∏ª

üîß Explanation
	‚Ä¢	The Master Process (a.k.a. the main Node.js process) is responsible for:
	‚Ä¢	Detecting how many CPU cores are available.
	‚Ä¢	Spawning a new Worker Process (child process) for each CPU core using cluster.fork().
	‚Ä¢	Monitoring the health of workers.
	‚Ä¢	Each Worker Process runs independently, but handles the same code (Express app in your case).
	‚Ä¢	The OS load balancer distributes incoming connections among the workers.

You can sketch or use the following structure for a slide:

         +-------------------+
         |   Master Process  |  (PID: 1234)
         +-------------------+
                   |
      +------------+-------------+
      |            |             |
+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
|  Worker #1  | |  Worker #2  | |  Worker #3  |  ... (up to # of CPU cores)
|  (PID: 2345)| |  (PID: 2346)| |  (PID: 2347)|
+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+

 Each worker runs:
 - Express server
 - Handles client requests
